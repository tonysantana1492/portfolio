  Senior Software Engineer Fullâ€‘Stack with 7+ years of experience spanning the entire web product lifecycle. I apply clean code principles, SOLID patterns, and design patterns while working comfortably across frontend (React/Next.js) and backend (NestJS/Node) with SQL/NoSQL databases and cloud deployments. In teams, I combine technical focus with project management and close collaboration with product teams.
